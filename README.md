## What is this pattern?

The Command Pattern is a design pattern (a template for how to solve a programming problem) that encapsulates all of the information about a specific action or event, and sets it up so it can be called at a later time by any other script. This keeps the code clean and isolated, and simplifies the process of calling the action or event. An added benefit is that any script calling on the command doesnâ€™t need to know anything about the command itself. It simply makes the call, and the rest is taken care of.
